# LearnYouAHaskell_Examples
All of the examples from the wonderful ["Learn You A Haskell"](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) book. 

The python file generates the html file with all of the examples from ["Learn You A Haskell."](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) please support the author!
The html generated is a bit rough, as I am still learning. Enjoy!
